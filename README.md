# Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Canadian Student Labor Force Participation Rate

# Introduction
When considering the economic implications of major recessions such as the 2008 global financial crisis
and the recent recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the state of the labour force is among the
most important economic factors to understand. Typically the metric to reach for in these cases is the
unemployment rate, since it can be easily understood that a severe recession will cause unemployment rates
to rise. However, another statistic – the labour force participation rate – is also a very useful metric when
considering the health of the labour market.
Investopedia defines the labour force participation rate as “the percentage of all people of working age who
are employed or are actively seeking work.”1 It differs from the unemployment rate in that it includes
working-age individuals who may have been unemployed, but are willing and able to work. This means that
some people who are unemployed are still considered to be part of the labour force. Individuals who have
given up on their search for re-employment are referred to as “discouraged workers”2 and are excluded from
the labour force. Examining the labour force participation rate can therefore offer additional insight on the
state of workers themselves beyond whether or not they are currently working; an increase in the labour
force participation rate can be generally interpreted as an increase in the willingness to work of a group
of individuals, and a decrease indicates a general decrease in their willingness to work, and consequently, a
larger number of discouraged workers. We will conduct such an analysis in this report.
The objective of this analysis is to make use of confidence intervals to estimate the the range of values for
the population mean and variance of the labour force participation rate. The dataset that we will be using
in this analysis is the Unemployment rate, participation rate, and employment rate by type of student during
school months, monthly, unadjusted for seasonality3 dataset provided by Statistics Canada. This dataset
provides monthly percentages for the unemployment rate, participation rate, and employment rate of fulltime
students, part-time students, and non-students of both sexes from the ages of 15 to 24. In order to make
this analysis slightly more relevant to us as students, we will be analyzing the labour force participation rate
for Ontario-based full-time students only, from January 2000 to February 2021.
Our hypothesis is that confidence interval for the mean labour force participation rate should indicate that a
significant portion of students participate in the labour force, since many students often need to work to meet
their increased financial needs due to educational costs, or participate in training or internship programs.
Our prediction for the population variance of the labour force participation rate is that its confidence interval
should be relatively wide, since the time period from 2000-2021 includes two major recessions along with
other periods of economic upturn, which should have caused significant fluctuations in the state of the labour
force.
